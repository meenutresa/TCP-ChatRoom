My Student Id : 17312351

Chat Server is implemented in Python3. Some of the names of the libraries are different in Python3 from other python versions.

The libraries used are default python libraries in python3.

To run the Chat_Server.py, run start.sh file passing port number as command line argument.
./start.sh <port_number>
example : ./start.sh 5000

Please note that Chat_Client.py is created only for my testing purpose. The Chat_Server.py will work with test client that is provided online.
